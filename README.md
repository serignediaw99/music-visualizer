# Music Visualizer

A deep learning project that generates artistic visualizations from music using neural networks. This project combines audio processing with computer vision to create unique visual representations of music.

## Project Overview

This project uses deep learning techniques to analyze music and generate corresponding visual art. It processes audio input and creates visual representations that capture the mood, rhythm, and characteristics of the music.

## Features

- Audio processing and analysis
- Neural network-based visualization generation
- Support for various music formats
- Artistic style transfer capabilities
- Real-time visualization generation
